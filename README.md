# meteor-react-starter
I've just started to play with React, and I'm using a variation of this to spawn new projects. There's not much in here, and it's not perfect.

##Usage:
1. Install Meteor
-Mac OS X/Linux: `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`
-Windows: [Download](https://install.meteor.com/windows) the official installer
2. Checkout from GitHub
3. Start hacking!
