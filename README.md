# meteor-react-starter
I've just started to play with React, and I'm using a variation of this to spawn new projects. There's not much in here, and it's not perfect.

##Usage:
1. Install Meteor for Mac OS X/Linux: `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh` or with the official Windows [installer](https://install.meteor.com/windows)
2. Clone from GitHub with `git clone https://github.com/KamuelaFranco/meteor-react-starter.git`
3. Start hacking!
